description: "Moved blog from wordpress to Gatsby"
---

Took the decision to move my wordpress blog to gatsby. 

Was as simple as running.

```
  gatsby new my-blog https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog
```

Reasons included hopefully saving on hosting fees.  I'm using netlify as a free host for now but as its a static site now it can site anywhere i.e github pages..
I should be able to update it via github GUI. Hopefully it'll be more secure i.e. no database involved, no wordpress involved.
