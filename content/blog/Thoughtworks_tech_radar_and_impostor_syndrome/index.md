One site I regularly visit is tech radar to see if there are any new advances in programming that I should be looking at.  Usually a lot of it is over my head but sometimes I’ll come across something that I will look into further and sometimes even being aware of these terms has proved useful. I recommend you visit every now and then https://www.thoughtworks.com.

A lot of the time it can bring out my impostor syndrome and I think I’m missing out on a lot of good nice tech because I just don’t have the time to keep up.  I do my best in my own time to research and improve myself but I see things move into the archive section of the radar that completely slipped by me. Wish I had more time to try out some of these but I already feel like I am sacrificing a lot of family time just to do what I already do.

I consider myself a fullstack developer and although my work has mostly revolved around Java/Spring and angular I feel that I’m spread so thin that I know nothing and I am inferior to all of my peers. I know you can’t know everything and people have their own strengths, I know it can be exciting to live in a rapidly changing environment but I wish things would slow down for 5 minutes and not have a new framework released that I don’t have time to learn.
