Docker can be a pain to install.  You can follow lots of install instructions and apt-get install or just follow execute this.

wget -qO- https://get.docker.com/ | sh
also, to install docker-compose

sudo apt-get -y install python-pip
sudo pip install docker-compose
most of this taken from here

https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-compose-on-ubuntu-14-04

I do recommend the digital ocean tutorials.
