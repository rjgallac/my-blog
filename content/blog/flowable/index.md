Seems like a nice port of activiti [https://www.flowable.org/documentation.html](https://www.flowable.org/documentation.html). I have tried it and of the little examples I’ve created it seems a little easier than activiti. A nice little addition is to start up an entire stack which includes a great little modeler
```
    docker run --name flowable -p 8080:8080 flowable/all-in-one
```
